          The <strong>budgerigar</strong>, also known as the
          <em>common parakeet</em> or <em>shell parakeet</em>, is a small,
          long-tailed, seed-eating parrot usually nicknamed the budgie or in
          American English, the parakeet. Budgies are the only species in the
          genus Melopsittacus. Naturally, the species is green and yellow with
          black, scalloped markings on the nape, back, and wings. Budgies are
          bred in captivity with colouring of blues, whites, yellows, greys, and
          even with small crests. Juveniles and chicks are monomorphic, while
          adults are told apart by their cere colouring, and their behaviour.

            The little budgie bird is one of the most popular pets in the world,
            ranking just behind dogs and cats, and it's no wonder. This
            affectionate, cute bird is small and inexpensive, and if trained
            properly a budgie can mimic human speech. The origin of its formal
            name‚Äïbudgerigar‚Äïis a mystery, but by any name, this little bird is a
            charming companion for most pet owners. Budgies aren't all fun and
            games, though, so before you bring one home, make sure you're not in
            for any surprises. Here are some key things to know about budgie
            birds.
          </p>

          <h2>
            1. All Budgies Are Parakeets, But Not All Parakeets Are Budgies
          </h2>
          <p class="main">
            Some people refer to budgies by their full name (budgerigars), and
            some call them parakeets. But while budgies are parakeets, there are
            many different types of parakeets, and they come in a variety of
            colors, shapes, and sizes. Some parakeets, like the Indian ringneck
            parakeet, are very large‚Äîreaching lengths of up to 16 inches from
            head to tail‚Äîwhile budgies are much smaller. Because of these vast
            differences in size and more, it is more accurate to refer to these
            birds by their true name.
          </p>

          <h2>2. They're One of the Smallest True Parrot Species</h2>
          <p class="main">
            They're not the smallest parrots‚Äïthat distinction belongs to the
            parrotlet‚Äïbut budgies are quite tiny. Most budgies in captivity
            average between 7 or 8 inches from the beak to the tip of the tail.
            Wild budgies in their native habitat of Australia are even smaller.
          </p>

          <h2>3. There Are Two Different Types</h2>
          <p class="main">
            Not many people realize that there are actually two distinct types
            of budgies‚Äïthe traditional Budgerigar, hailing from Australia, and
            the larger English budgie, bred in England specifically for the show
            and the pet trade. While the two are clearly both budgies, there are
            differences when they're observed side by side. English budgies are
            usually 1 to 2 inches longer than their Australian counterparts and
            have larger heads and puffier feathers around their faces and
            crowns.
          </p>

          <h2>4. Budgies Can Learn to Talk Better Than Some Larger Parrots</h2>
          <p class="main">
            There's no way to guarantee that your budgie, or any other parrot,
            will learn to "speak." However, budgies certainly have a knack for
            it, and many times they speak with greater clarity and broader
            vocabularies than larger parrot species such as macaws and
            cockatoos.
            <br />
            While their voices are small and gravelly-sounding, budgies have an
            impressive ability to pick up on human words and phrases, and even
            using them in proper context sometimes. They are a great choice for
            those new to bird ownership who want to own a talking parrot.
          </p>

          <h2>5. Green Is the Only Natural Color for Budgies</h2>
          <p class="main">
            While people are normally accustomed to seeing a variety of colored
            budgies for sale in pet shops, the only natural color of budgies in
            the wild is the yellow/green variety. All other budgies, including
            the blue budgies, white budgies, and others, are color mutations
            bred specifically for the pet trade. There's nothing wrong with
            these birds, but don't expect to see a blue budgie in the wild.
          </p>

          <h2>6. Try a Varied Diet</h2>
          <p class="main">
            Since they're small, budgies are relatively inexpensive to care for
            and feed. But contrary to popular belief, a diet consisting only of
            seeds is not good for a small bird like a budgie, and can even cause
            health problems. Instead, veterinarians recommend a budgie diet that
            includes pellets and fresh fruits and vegetables including leafy
            greens. It's OK to feed budgies a small amount of seeds as part of
            this diet, as long as the base of their diet is pellets, vegetables,
            and small amounts of fruit.
